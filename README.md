# Draw Together
Draw Together is a set of companion applications designed as an inclass activity for primary students with speech and/or language disorders. This GitHub repository is a high-fidelity, functional prototype of the student application interface. The intention of this prototype is to mimic the functionality and interface of the envisioned final design solution in a short time frame. Draw Together is designed for iPad and other touchscreen devices that can be found in primary school learning environments, and as such, some CSS styling may seem weird if used on a standard 1920 x 1080 monitor.

## Set-up requirements
- Node.js

To set up the application. Download the code from this repo, and run 'npm install' in the backend folder. Once finished, run 'node app.js' to host the server locally. Finally you can access the application by going to 'http://localhost:3000' in your desired browser (make sure the server is running). This application is not supported by internet explorer, but if that's your desired browser, I'm worried for you.

For more detailed set-up instructions, please read the .pdf in the repo labelled 'Set-up Instructions'.
